JackInTheBox
============

Code for Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3 running a jack in the box.

Master branch will always have runnable code.  With the correct board/setup, it should always do something with either the audio circuit or the box.

FeatureDevelopment branch can be used for incomplete features.  Branch further for each individual feature, then merge back in here.
